# A Final Symphony
A Final Symphony: our requiem.

An anthem of heroes and tears.

When the daylight pierced through the branches, We understood we were standing before God.

And here you are,
on the edge of the creator.

Listening the echoes of a written story.

See
The world will collapse.

And while you stand in the midst of nothingness, searching for light in the darkness

Only grasping the truth in the final reckoning :

We were Caught in the Rubicon's flow.

Behind the high ramparts, where it cannot see us, we recite our final words

Motherland, bless your children who are about to die.

Beyond my sword, and behind my shield
I smile

because against all odds

I will triumph.
